1. Top 10 Vehicles by Make
   ![Screenshot (921)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/841d4163-0198-402b-ab34-8bffe49e79fa)
Each bar represents a vehicle manufacturer (make) with the total number of vehicles attributed to that make.
        The length of the bar correlates with the number of vehicles, providing a clear visual comparison.
The above fig delivers the following insights:
* Top 10 Vehicle Makes:
  The top vehicle makes are listed from highest to lowest in terms of the number of vehicles sold.

* Color Encoding:
  Different shades of green are used to represent each make, where the darker shades indicate a higher number of vehicles.

Tesla Dominates the Market:
        Tesla is by far the largest manufacturer in terms of vehicle count, with 68,943 vehicles. This represents a substantial market share compared to the other manufacturers.

Nissan and Chevrolet Follow:
        Nissan follows with 13,497 vehicles, and Chevrolet comes in third with 12,025 vehicles.
        These two companies hold strong positions but are still significantly behind Tesla.

    Mid-Tier Manufacturers:
        Ford (7,601), BMW (6,439), and Kia (6,198) form the next tier of manufacturers, contributing moderate numbers of vehicles compared to the top three.

Smaller Contributors:
        Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo, and Jeep round out the top 10, each with fewer than 6,000 vehicles, showing a much smaller market presence compared to the top few manufacturers.

Key Insights:

    Tesla's Market Leadership: Tesla's massive lead suggests that they dominate the electric vehicle market, far outpacing competitors.
    Nissan and Chevrolet: While Nissan and Chevrolet are significant players, their vehicle numbers are a fraction of Tesla's, indicating a much smaller market share.
    Market Concentration: The top three manufacturers (Tesla, Nissan, and Chevrolet) represent a substantial portion of the market, while the remaining companies contribute significantly fewer vehicles.

3. Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility

       Bar Graph Representation:
        The thick green bar visually represents the total number of vehicles for a particular category of CAFV eligibility.
        The two specific values highlighted indicate subsets of total vehicles.

    Top Label (60,613):
        This value represents 60,613 vehicles with the note: "Eligibility unknown as battery range has not been researched." These vehicles are likely part of a group where their eligibility status for CAFV could not be determined due to missing data, particularly related to battery range.

    Bottom Label (14,287):
        This value represents 14,287 vehicles that are "Not eligible due to low battery range." This subset indicates vehicles that do not qualify for CAFV eligibility because their battery range falls below the required threshold.

    Average Line (43,608.33):
        There is a dotted horizontal line showing the average value of 43,608.33 vehicles across different categories. This average might help indicate how the numbers compare with other segments or eligibility statuses not visible in this view.

Observations:

    Higher Number of Vehicles with Unknown Eligibility: The largest subset consists of vehicles whose eligibility status is undetermined due to insufficient data on battery range. This could indicate a gap in data collection or the need for further research on these vehicles' specifications.

    Smaller Number of Ineligible Vehicles: The subset of vehicles ineligible due to low battery range is significantly smaller (14,287). These vehicles likely don't meet the minimum criteria for range to be considered for CAFV eligibility.

    Position of the Average: The average line falls between these two values, closer to the total ineligible vehicles (14,287). This suggests that the unknown category (60,613) is pulling the overall average upwards. If the unknown data were clarified, the distribution of eligible vehicles might show a different pattern.

       Area Chart Representation:
        The green shaded area shows the total vehicle sales across different years. The area expands as the sales numbers grow over time.
    Yearly Data Points:
        Each year is marked with the total number of vehicles sold.
        Key data points are visible for specific years (e.g., 2011 to 2024), showing fluctuations in sales.

Observations:

    Steady Growth in Sales (2011â€“2018):
        The vehicle sales show a consistent increase from 2011, starting at 786 vehicles, and peaking at 12,596 vehicles in 2018.
        There is noticeable growth between 2011 and 2018, suggesting increased demand or expansion of the market.

    Sales Decline in 2019:
        After the peak in 2018, sales dropped to 9,263 vehicles in 2019. This could be due to market saturation, economic factors, or other industry challenges.

    Recovery and Peak in 2023:
        Sales showed a modest recovery, rising to 30,366 vehicles by 2023, marking the highest point in the dataset. This significant growth could indicate renewed demand, introduction of new models, or favorable market conditions.

    Sharp Drop in 2024:
        The chart shows a dramatic decline in 2024, with only 305 vehicles sold. This might indicate that the year 2024 is incomplete in the dataset or that some external factor, such as a shift in the market, has caused a significant decrease in vehicle sales.

Key Insights:

    Rapid Market Expansion: The sharp rise from 2011 to 2023 suggests strong market growth over the years, peaking in 2023.
    Volatility: The decline in 2019 and the sharp drop in 2024 reflect fluctuations in the market, potentially due to economic factors, shifts in consumer demand, or other external events.
    Data Gap in 2024: The dramatic drop in 2024 may suggest incomplete data for the year or a major market disruption that impacted sales.
